**NASA APOD Explorer**

A small web app that displays NASA’s Astronomy Picture of the Day, supporting both images and videos. The project focuses on clean UI, reliable API handling, and a simple, extensible architecture that can later include more NASA datasets.

Tech Stack
- Next.js (App Router) for server-side rendering and routing
- React + TypeScript for type-safe UI development
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- NASA APOD API as the data source
- Vercel for deployment and environment management

The app fetches data server-side, handles both image and video content, and uses caching to optimize performance.
